# odin-recipes
HTML recipes project
In this project I am going to put into practice everything I have learnt
in the Odin foundations course - HTML section. This includes the HTML Boilerplate,
headings, paragraphs, strong and emphasised text, links and images etc.
I will also be practicing GIT commits and GIT comments.
